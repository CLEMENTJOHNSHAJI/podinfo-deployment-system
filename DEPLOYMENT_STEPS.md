# 🚀 Deployment Steps (No Docker Required!)

## Prerequisites ✅
- [x] GitHub Account
- [x] AWS Account with CLI configured
- [x] Terraform installed
- [x] No Docker needed! (GitHub Actions handles this)

## Step 1: Configure Your Project ⚙️

Run the setup script to configure your deployment:

```bash
cd /Users/clementjohnshaji/podinfo-deployment-system
./setup-config.sh
```

**What this does:**
- Asks for your GitHub username
- Asks for your AWS Account ID (12 digits)
- Creates `terraform/terraform.tfvars` with your settings
- Generates GitHub secrets template

## Step 2: Deploy AWS Infrastructure 🏗️

```bash
cd terraform
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

**What this creates:**
- ECR repositories (for storing your app images)
- Lambda function (serverless version)
- EC2 instances (traditional servers)
- Application Load Balancer
- VPC and security groups
- CloudWatch monitoring
- IAM roles for GitHub Actions

**Important:** Save the outputs from `terraform apply` - you'll need them for GitHub!

## Step 3: Set Up GitHub Repository 📁

1. **Create GitHub repository:**
   - Go to GitHub.com → New Repository
   - Name: `podinfo-deployment-system`
   - Make it **Public** (for free GitHub Actions)
   - Don't initialize with README

2. **Push your code:**
```bash
cd /Users/clementjohnshaji/podinfo-deployment-system
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Podinfo deployment system"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/podinfo-deployment-system.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 4: Configure GitHub Secrets 🔐

1. **Go to your GitHub repository:**
   - Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

2. **Add these secrets:**
   - `AWS_ROLE_ARN`: (from Terraform output)
   - `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`: (your AWS account ID)
   - `AWS_REGION`: `us-west-2`

## Step 5: Deploy Your Application 🚀

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to production"
git push origin main
```

**What happens:**
1. GitHub Actions builds your Docker images in the cloud
2. Signs them for security
3. Pushes to AWS ECR
4. Deploys to Lambda and EC2
5. Runs health checks

## Step 6: Monitor Your Deployment 📊

- **GitHub Actions:** Check the Actions tab in your repository
- **AWS Console:** Monitor your resources
- **Application URLs:** (from Terraform output)

## 🎯 Your Application URLs

After deployment, you'll have:

1. **Lambda URL:** `https://abc123.lambda-url.us-west-2.on.aws/`
2. **ALB URL:** `http://podinfo-alb-123456789.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com/`

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Terraform fails:
- Check AWS credentials: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
- Verify region: `aws configure list`
- Check permissions: Make sure your AWS user has admin access

### If GitHub Actions fails:
- Check repository secrets
- Verify AWS role ARN
- Check GitHub Actions logs

### If application doesn't work:
- Check CloudWatch logs
- Verify security groups
- Check load balancer health

## 🧹 Cleanup

To remove everything and stop billing:
```bash
cd terraform
terraform destroy
```

## 💰 Cost Estimate

- **First 12 months:** ~$5-10/month (with AWS free tier)
- **After free tier:** ~$50/month
- **AWS gives you $300 free credits!**

## 🎉 What You've Built

You now have a production-ready application with:
- ✅ Automatic deployments from GitHub
- ✅ Security scanning and signing
- ✅ Multi-target deployment (Lambda + EC2)
- ✅ Auto-scaling and health checks
- ✅ Complete monitoring and alerting
- ✅ Blue/green deployments with rollback

**No Docker required on your MacBook!** 🎊
